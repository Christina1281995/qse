This project is intended to help <b>you</b> take a first look into solar panels for your own home. Many websites out there can be quite complex (how are we supposed to know what the exact tilt and orientation of our roofs are... in degrees?!). <br> <br>
This website is therefore designed to give you a basic first insight into the solar potential. The main focus is simply to get you started on your own <b>journey towards sustainable energy</b>.
